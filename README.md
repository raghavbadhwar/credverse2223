A starter scaffold for projects in the Credverse ecosystem. This project is intended to provide a base structure, development tooling, and boilerplate setup for building scalable apps.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express (optional)
- Git + GitHub
- GitHub Actions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raghavbadhwar/credverse-scaffold.git
   cd credverse-scaffold
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Express server defined in `index.js`. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000` and should see a greeting message.

## 🧪 Testing

To run the automated tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

The default test suite uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to verify that the root route returns the expected greeting message.

## 🛠️ Development

- `.gitignore` already configured
- Add your own `.env` files as needed
- Use GitHub Actions for automated CI
